In anlyzing the evictions data, I frist compared the total of all evcitions by zipcode from 2017-present to median household income for 2021 by zipcode too. Overall, evictions occured in locations with low median household incomes which is intutitive. For the evictions map, evictions were concetrated mainly in the bronx and aouth-eastern Queens. Surpsiinlgy, there was high but less concentration of evictions in the lower east side of Manhattan which had very high median household incomes.

I explored other dimensions to further explore the evictions data. I noticed that areas with the highest evacuation rates had the lowes percentage of families. This could mean that most evicted people were not single and not families. I wanted to further analyze that, I decided to use data of households where a female is householder and a husband is not present. In areas with high percentages where females are the households and a husband is not present, I noticed a correlation with high numbers of evacuations.
