In analyzing the evictions data, I first compared the total of all evictions by zip code from 2017-present to median household income for 2021 by zip code too. Overall, evictions occurred in locations with low median household incomes which is intuitive. For the evictions map, evictions were concentrated mainly in the Bronx and south-eastern Queens. Surprisingly, there was high but less concentration of evictions in the lower east side of Manhattan which had very high median household incomes.

I explored other dimensions to further explore the evictions data. I noticed that areas with the highest evacuation rates had the lowest percentage of families. This could mean that most evicted people were not single and not families. I wanted to further analyze that, I decided to use data of households where a female is householder, and a husband is not present. In areas with high percentages where females are the households and a husband is not present, I noticed a correlation with high numbers of evacuations. Based on a business insider article, "When it comes to gender, women face 16% higher eviction rates than men, which translates to thousands more women renters evicted than men, according to a study by the Eviction Lab." This holds true based on the used data and one can say that higher eviction rates exist withing low-income areas especially where women and minorities live.

Another analysis of the evictions data was how much it changed over the pandemic considering the protections provided to tenants. Over the years before the pandemic, the numbers were very consistent and almost the same relatively. As the pandemic started in 2021 and the lockdown was imposed during March, the evictions numbers went drastically down to almost zero. This was due to legislations passed to protect tenants and as of now Governor Hochul signed a new "moratorium on COVID-related Residential and Commercial Evictions into Law, Effective Through January 15, 2022."

Main data source was NYC Open Data for evictions and Simply Analytics for the additional data presented.
